# Brightness Slider and NoSleep
You might notice two little applications have been installed along with OS X Patcher's other patches. They help solve some issues and should be opened and configured after patching. NoSleep is open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/integralpro/nosleep). Brightness Slider is made by ACT Productions and can be found on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brightness-control/id456624497?ls=1&mt=12).

# Graphics acceleration
Your Mac won't support graphics acceleration with this patcher. This means brightness control and sleep won't work (on non-ATI cards) (see above) and applications that rely on your graphics card will perform slower or will simply not work. parrotgeek1 will soon release a patcher with support for graphics acceleration on certain Macs.
